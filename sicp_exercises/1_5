Applicative order evalutes argument expressions in order then.
Normal order expands all expressions then evaluates them which can duplicated work.
Scheme uses applicative order.

In applicative-order, test procedure is called and the special form if statement is reaached, returning a value of 0 since x = 0. Only the first expression is called since the predicate returned true.


In normal order, the expressions are expanded first so (p) is evaluated which recursively redifines itself over and over again infinitely. The predicate is never reached for evaluation.
